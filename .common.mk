# .common.mk

# First, include a .custom.mk that _may or may not_ exist. The leading "-"
# means that make will ignore the error if a file isn't found.
# If this file is in a different directory, pass the option
# "--include-dir that_dir" to make, where "that_dir" is the file's
# location. This is another tool for customizing the make process,
# in addition to overrides and other definitions in the Makefile.
# One use is to add additional dependencies to standard targets defined
# in this file. This is why many targets are defined like this:
#   foo:: foo-prerequisite foo-command foo-postrequisite
#
# The "foo-command" is where the main work is done, such as running
# tests or linting code. If you need to do something before "foo-command",
# then add a dependency to "foo-prerequisite" and have it do the work
# required. Similarly, after "foo-command", use "foo-postrequisite" as a
# hook for any cleanup, etc.
#
# Similarly, you can *disable* a command by overriding the definition of
# foo-command, as discussed in a long comment below.
#
# For most projects, this sort of customization is easy enough to do in
# the main Makefile. We support the .custom.mk file idiom, because it is
# useful in Project Tapestry's "contrib" directories for customization of
# make targets *just within those directories*. See that project's .common.mk
# and READMEs for more details (https://github.com/The-AI-Alliance/tapestry/).

print-info-custom::

# In what follows, note the structure used for common tasks, like running the unit tests:
#   unit-tests:: unit-tests-prerequisite unit-tests-command unit-tests-postrequisite
# The *-prerequisite and *-postrequisite are hooks that permit a .custom.mk (or a Makefile)
# to add additional dependencies or recipes to execute before or after the "core" command is
# executed by the *-command target.  The *-prerequisite and *-postrequisite all have empty
# recipes in this file. So, if you want to define them with custom behaviors, you must use
# the double-colon syntax, "::", like this:
#
# unit-tests-prerequisite:: even-more
#   @echo "Doing some unit testing setup..."
# even-more::
#   @echo "Doing even more stuff!"
#
# In contrast, the *-command targets are designed to be OVERRIDDEN. A common usage is to
# disable a task. For example, if there are no unit tests in the project, then
# unit-tests-command will fail, because of how it is defined below. (This isn't true for
# ruff, black, pylint, and ty, which silently ignore when there is no python code.)
# So, projects without python tests should have the following definition in their Makefile:
#
# unit-tests-command::
#   @echo "${skip-command-target-message}"
#   @true
#
# The "skip-command-target-message" variable is defined in .common.mk to provide a
# useful notice to the reader that the target is skipped.
# TIP: Run "make skip-command-example" to see what the output looks like.
#
# There is one more point to explain for how this is implemented. The _default_ way
# *-command is actually declared is as follows:
#
# %-command::
#  	@${MAKE} ${@}-default
#
# Take for example, unit-tests-command. Because the .custom.mk file (if any) is read
# before this point in .common.mk, The target pattern "%-command" is _only_ used if
# .custom.mk (and Makefile) do not define unit-tests-command themselves. When
# this happens, the recipe calls `make unit-tests-command-default` to invoke the
# "default" command for unit tests.
#
# See the bottom of this file for a note about a previous, alternative
# implementation we used for this feature.

# The default implementation of any *-command target:
%-command:
	@${MAKE} ${@}-default
