# Open Trusted Data Initiative README

Welcome to the AI Alliance [Open Trusted Data Initiative](https://the-ai-alliance.github.io/open-trusted-data-initiative/) (OTDI).

## Vision
A high quality, trusted, open catalog / distributed repository of datasets for AI LLM pre-training and domain-specific fine-tuning that is amenable to a wide variety of use cases in enterprises, governments, regulated industries, and wherever high trust in the data foundations of AI is essential.

## Quick Tip - View the Website Locally

See [GITHUB_PAGES.md](GITHUB_PAGES.md) for information on viewing the site locally with `jekyll`.

## Other Documentation and Code

This repo will also be used for implementations, such as the planned catalog and data pipelines, until such time as it makes sense to split work into separate repos. Miscellaneous other documentation, not in the website, is also captured here:

* [`tools-notes`](tools-notes) - Notes on potential tool choices.
* [`data-processing-notes`](data-processing-notes) - Notes on requirements and data-specific tool choices.
* [`code`](code) - TBD
