## OTDI Website

The documentation for this repo is published using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). See [GITHUB_PAGES](GITHUB_PAGES.md) for details. The `docs` folder here contains the website code, but the `Makefile` in the root directory has targets for running the site locally, etc. See [`GITHUB_PAGES.md`](GITHUB_PAGES.md) for details.

## Other Documentation and Code

This repo will also be used for implementations, until such time as it makes sense to split work into separate repos. Miscellaneous other documentation, not in the website, is also captured here:

* [`tools-notes`](tools-notes) - Notes on potential tool choices.
* TBD - code.
