# HuggingFace tooling

The Hugging Face Hub is home to a growing collection of [datasets](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/datasets) that 
span a variety of domains and tasks.
Each dataset in Hugging face is a Git repository that contains the data required to generate splits for 
training, evaluation, and testing. You can look at these repositories directly through the web:

```
https://huggingface.co/datasets/<username>/<model-name>
```

In addition to this you ca use:

* [Hub web UI](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/datasets-adding#upload-using-the-hub-ui) to create
a repository, examine it, upload and download files, and create a dataset card
* [Huggingface_hub client library](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/datasets-adding#using-the-huggingfacehub-client-library). 
More on the library is [here](data_access).
* [Other libraries](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/datasets-adding#using-other-libraries). The lis
of libraries supporting Hugging face Hub can be found [here](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/datasets-libraries)
* [Git](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/datasets-adding#using-git). As datasets are GIT repositories
(with the specific locations managed by Hugging face) direct git commands can be used for their management. For 
example the following command:

```commandline
git clone git@hf.co:datasets/blublinsky/test
```
can be used for cloning a `test` repo for the user `blublinsky`

Overall structure of the dataset repository is shown below:

![Overall repo](images/overall.png)

The main part of repository is data, containing, the actual dataset data (as parquet files) 

![Data](images/repo_data.png)

THe evaluation contains different types of data evaluation (in csv format)

![Evaluation](images/eval.png)

Each dataset may be documented by the README.md file in the repository. This file is 
called a dataset card, and the Hugging Face Hub will render its contents on the datasetâ€™s main page.

To control how the Hub displays the card, you should create a 
[YAML section](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/datasets-cards#dataset-card-metadata)
in the README file to define some metadata. 

The metadata that you add to the dataset card enables certain interactions on the Hub. For example:

* Allow users to filter and discover datasets at https://huggingface.co/datasets.
* If you choose a license using the keywords listed in the right column of this table, the license will be displayed on 
the dataset page.

When creating a README.md file in a dataset repository on the Hub, you can use Metadata UI to fill the main metadata 
components. You can also refer to [documentation](https://github.com/huggingface/datasets/blob/main/templates/README_guide.md)
or use the hugging face [application](https://huggingface.co/spaces/huggingface/datasets-tagging). The complete spec is
available [here](https://github.com/huggingface/hub-docs/blob/main/datasetcard.md?plain=1)
