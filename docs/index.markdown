# Contribute to the Future of AI with Open, Trusted Data!

_Join **The AI Alliance Open Trusted Data Initiative** (OTDI), where our mission is to create a comprehensive, crowd-sourced data catalog for AI model training, domain-specific tuning, and related uses._

<<<<<<< HEAD
Why Contribute to OTDI?

* **Empower AI Innovation:** Your data helps build more accurate, fair, and versatile AI models.
* **Transparency & Trust:** Every contribution is transparent, with robust data provenance, governance, and trust mechanisms. Bring your expertise to help us improve all aspects of data management.
* **Tailored Contributions:** Support domain-specific model tuning to create open foundation models relevant to your industry or domain of interest.
* **Recognition:** Get credited for your data contributions, which help the industry move to a more open, end-to-end development process for AI models and applications, with all the traditional benefits of open source software development.

A current challenge in AI is the &ldquo;murky&rdquo; provenance of many datasets used for training large language models (LLMs), which raises concerns for model developers and users of the potential for models to output private, confidential, and copyrighted information that might have been part of the training dataset, among other concerns. This is one of the reasons that most models that allow &ldquo;open&rdquo; use rarely include publication of their training dataset and the full source code for all the filtering and transformation steps used to create that dataset, from initial acquisition to the its final form before training. At best, _open models_ limit themselves to descriptions in general terms of the data sources and methods used.

OTDI aims to address these concerns with an industry wide effort to gather and process data fully in the open, allowing model developers and users to have full confidence in the provenance of the data they use.

This document provides more background OTDI. It is organized as follows:
