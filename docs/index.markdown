# Building the Future of Open, Trusted Data for AI

{: .hightlight}
> _Join **The AI Alliance, Open Trusted Data Initiative** (OTDI), where our mission is to create a comprehensive, widely-sourced catalog of datasets with clear licenses for use, explicit provenance guarantees, and governed transformations, intended for AI model training, RAG (retrieval augmented generation), tuning, and other uses._
>
> _In our context_ Trusted Data _means the provenance and governance of the dataset is clear and unambiguous. The metadata about the dataset provides clarity about its intended purposes, safety, and other considerations, along with any filtering and other processing that were done on the dataset._

# Why Contribute?

So, why should you get involved?

* **Collaborate on AI Innovation:** Your data helps build more accurate, fair, and versatile AI models. You can also connect with like-minded data scientists, AI researchers, and industry leaders in the AI Alliance.
* **Transparency & Trust:** Every contribution is transparent, with robust data provenance, governance, and trust mechanisms. We welcome your expertise to help us improve all aspects of these processes.
* **Tailored Contributions:** We need domain-specific datasets to enable model tuning to create open foundation models relevant to your industry or domain of interest.
* **Recognition:** Get credited for your data contributions and help us build momentum towards better-governed, more open, and fully-capable datasets for all AI needs.

# Why Is Trusted Data Important?

A significant challenge today is the &ldquo;murky&rdquo; provenance of many datasets used for training foundation models (FMs), like large language models (LLMs). Model developers and users risk the potential for models regenerating private, confidential, and copyrighted information that might have been part of the training dataset, among other concerns. This is one of the reasons that most models that allow unrestricted (&ldquo;open&rdquo;) use rarely include publication of their training dataset and the full source code for all the filtering and transformation steps used to create that dataset, from initial acquisition to its final form before training. At best, _open models_ limit themselves to descriptions in general terms of the data sources and methods used.

OTDI aims to address these concerns with an industry wide effort to gather and process data fully in the open, allowing model developers and users to have full confidence in the provenance and governance of the data they use.

## Delivering Trust

What does delivering trust mean? We wish to enable the following:

* **Data Exploration:** Finding datasets that meet your governance requirements and fully support your needs.
* **Data Cleaning:** Datasets processed for specific objectives (e.g., deduplication, hate speech removal, etc.) with open-source data pipelines.
* **Data Auditing:** End-to-end governance, ie., traceability, of all activity involving the dataset.
* **Data Documentation:** Metadata that covers all important aspects of a dataset.
