Use the following template to create your dataset card. Replace all the content marked with `{...}` with appropriate values and add additional text as you see fit. Note the HTML-style comments `<!-- ... -->`, which you can remove, and also pay attention to sections marked required. Keep in mind our goals for OTDI and how this metadata supports those goals.  

If you are uncertain about what a particular section requires, add questions in that section! When you submit this card with your dataset, we will provide answers, as well as other feedback. 

For more information on dataset card metadata, see the [Hugging Face guide](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/datasets-cards) and their [card specification](https://github.com/huggingface/hub-docs/blob/main/datasetcard.md?plain=1), from which this card template is adapted.

> **NOTE:** We intend to turn this template into a form for easier preparation. Apologies in the meantime...

Here is the template:
