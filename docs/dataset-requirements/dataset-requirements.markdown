Here are the requirements to contribute a dataset to the Open Trusted Dataset Initiative.

## License

A core goal for all OTDI datasets is that they support permissive usage. Therefore, we require that _all contributed datasets_ support the [CDLA Permissive 2.0](https://cdla.dev/permissive-2-0/) license ([SPDX link](https://spdx.org/licenses/CDLA-Permissive-2.0.html)). 


## Dataset Card

All useful datasets include _metadata_ about their provenance, target uses, etc. To provide a uniform, standardized way of expressing this metadata, we ask you to submit a completed _Dataset Card_ when you [contribute the dataset]({{site.baseurl}}/contributing).

Please create a copy of the [dataset card template text]({{site.baseurl}}/dataset-requirements/dataset-card-template) and replace all the content marked with `{...}` with appropriate values. Add additional text as you see fit (Note the suggestions in HTML-style comments `<!-- ... -->`). When you submit this card with your dataset, we'll provide feedback. If you are uncertain about what a particular section requires, add questions in that section!

> **WARNING:** At this time, we can only accept text files with one of the following extensions: `*.txt`, `*.md`, or `*.markdown`.
