# Why Is Trusted Data Important?

A significant challenge today for users of datasets is the desire for clear licenses to use the data, assurances that the data was sourced appropriately (the provenance), and trust that the data has been securely and traceably managed (governance).

## The Value of Governance

Governance of datasets delivers these benefits:

* **Strengthens Trust:** Demonstrates a commitment to safeguarding data and enhancing its reputation.
* **Boosts Operational Efficiency:** Reduces redundancies and inefficiencies by ensuring consistent data management and quality practices.
* **Supports Innovation:** Having reliable, well-managed data can fuel analytics, AI, and other technological innovations.
* **Regulatory Compliance:** Helps organizations meet legal and industry-specific requirements (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA) by ensuring data is properly managed.
* **Facilitates Accountability:** Clarifies stewardship of data, ensuring responsibility for its integrity and usage.
* **Enhances Decision-Making:** Trusted, high-quality data, enables easier consumption and more effective applications.

## Delivering Trust

OTDI addresses these concerns with an industry-wide effort to specify trustworthiness criteria and to catalog compliant datasets, allowing model builders and other users to have full confidence in the openness, provenance, and governance of the data they use.

Specifically, we are implementing the following:

* **Data Discovery:** We are finding datasets that meet our governance criteria.
* **Data Exploration:** We are making the catalog of trustworthy datasets easy to browse and search, so you can find the datasets that support your needs. This means tracking important metadata for each dataset.
* **Data Auditing:** For every dataset, we explore its provenance and how it was governed.
* **Data Cleaning:** We are building _derived_ datasets processed for specific objectives, such minimizing duplication, removing hate speech, etc., using open-source data processing pipelines with full governance.

Our deliverables to the industry include the following:

* **Baseline Knowledge Datasets:** Openly-accessible and permissively-licensed text, code, image, audio, and video data that embodies a diverse range of global knowledge.
* **Domain-specific Datasets:** Comprehensive collections of datasets for tuning foundation models for target domains and applications.
* **Tooling and Platform Engineering:** Hosted pipelines, platform services, and compute capacity for synthetic dataset generation and data preparation at the scale needed to achieve the vision. Fully open-source, so you can use these tools as you see fit.

# Add Your Dataset to the Catalog

<!-- 
So, why should you get involved?

* **Collaborate on AI Innovation:** Your data can help build more accurate, fair, versatile, and open AI models. You can also connect with like-minded data scientists, AI researchers, and industry leaders in the AI Alliance.
* **Transparency & Trust:** Every contribution is transparent, with robust data provenance, governance, and trust mechanisms. We welcome your expertise to help us improve all aspects of these processes.
* **Tailored Contributions:** The world needs domain-specific datasets to enable model tuning to create open foundation models relevant to domains such as time series, and branches of science and industrial engineering. The world needs more multilingual, including underserved languages, and multimodel datasets. In many areas, the available real-world data is insufficient for the needs to innovate in those areas. Therefore, synthetic datasets are also needed.
