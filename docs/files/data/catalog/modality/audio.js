Through the speaker id there is additional information about the speaker, like gender, age, and place of birth (ie dialect). Through the proceedings id the corpus can be linked to the official proceedings from the meetings.\n\nThe corpus is in total sound recordings from 40 entire days of meetings. This amounts to 140 hours of speech, 65,000 sentences or 1.2 million words.\n\nThis dataset builds on this corpus.
