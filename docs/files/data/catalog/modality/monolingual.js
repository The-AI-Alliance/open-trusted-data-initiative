We develop a data generation pipeline that selects source passages, identifies candidate answers, generates questions, then finally filters or re-labels them to improve quality. Using this approach, we amplify a smaller human-written adversarial dataset to a much larger set of synthetic question-answer pairs. By incorporating our synthetic data, we improve the state-of-the-art on the AdversarialQA (https://adversarialqa.github.io/) dataset by 3.7F1 and improve model generalisation on nine of the twelve MRQA datasets. We further conduct a novel human-in-the-loop evaluation to show that our models are considerably more robust to new human-written adversarial examples: crowdworkers can fool our model only 8.8% of the time on average, compared to 17.6% for a model trained without synthetic data.\n\nFor full details on how the dataset was created, kindly refer to the paper.","url":"https://huggingface.co/datasets/Marbyun/internal-datasets","creator_name":"Ivan Rivaldo Marbun","creator_url":"https://huggingface.co/Marbyun","license_name":"MIT License","license_url":"https://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/","language":"en","first_N":5,"first_N_keywords":["question-answering","extractive-qa","open-domain-qa","generated","found"],"keywords_longer_than_N":true},

The CodiEsp corpus was selected manually by practicing\nphysicians and clinical documentalists and annotated by clinical coding\nprofessionals meeting strict quality criteria. They reached an inter-annotator\nagreement of 88.6% for diagnosis coding, 88.9% for procedure coding and 80.5%\nfor the textual reference annotation.\n\nThe final collection of 1,000 clinical cases that make up the corpus had a total\nof 16,504 sentences and 396,988 words. All documents are in Spanish language and\nCIE10 is the coding terminology (the Spanish version of ICD10-CM and ICD10-PCS).\nThe CodiEsp corpus has been randomly sampled into three subsets. The train set\ncontains 500 clinical cases, while the development and test sets have 250\nclinical cases each. In addition to these, a collection of 176,294 abstracts\nfrom Lilacs and Ibecs with the corresponding ICD10 codes (ICD10-CM and\nICD10-PCS) was provided by the task organizers.

We propose a black-box non-intrusive method that utilizes techniques\nfrom Domain Adaptation to reduce the domain gap, without requiring any human\nexpertise in the target language, by leveraging low-quality data in both a\nsupervised and unsupervised manner.

Users are free to model the data at the character-level, subword-level, or via any mechanism that can model an arbitrary string of text.\nTo compare models we propose to continue measuring the word-level perplexity, by calculating the total likelihood of the dataset (via any chosen subword vocabulary or character-based scheme) divided by the number of tokens --- specified below in the dataset statistics table.\nOne could use this dataset for benchmarking long-range language models, or use it to pre-train for other natural language processing tasks which require long-range reasoning, such as LAMBADA or NarrativeQA.

	{"name":"SOTAB","keyword":"monolingual","description":"# Understanding the semantics of table elements is a prerequisite for many data integration and data discovery tasks. Table annotation is the task of labeling table elements with terms from a given vocabulary. This paper presents the WDC Schema.org Table Annotation Benchmark (SOTAB) for comparing the performance of table annotation systems. SOTAB covers the column type annotation (CTA) and columns property annotation (CPA) tasks. SOTAB provides ∼50,000 annotated tables for each of the tasks containing Schema.org data from different websites. The tables cover 17 different types of entities such as movie, event, local business, recipe, job posting, or product. The tables stem from the WDC Schema.org Table Corpus which was created by extracting Schema.org annotations from the Common Crawl. Consequently, the labels used for annotating columns in SOTAB are part of the Schema.org vocabulary. The benchmark covers 91 types for CTA and 176 properties for CPA distributed across textual, numerical and date/time columns. The tables are split into fixed training, validation and test sets. The test sets are further divided into subsets focusing on specific challenges, such as columns with missing values or different value formats, in order to allow a more fine-grained comparison of annotation systems. The evaluation of SOTAB using Doduo and TURL shows that the benchmark is difficult to solve for current state-of-the-art systems.\n#","url":"https://huggingface.co/datasets/shivangibithel/SOTAB","creator_name":"Shivangi Bithel","creator_url":"https://huggingface.co/shivangibithel","license_name":"Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International Public License","license_url":"https://choosealicense.com/licenses/cc-by-4.0/","language":"en","first_N":5,"first_N_keywords":["crowdsourced","found","monolingual","original","English"],"keywords_longer_than_N":true},

We develop a data generation pipeline that selects source passages, identifies candidate answers, generates questions, then finally filters or re-labels them to improve quality. Using this approach, we amplify a smaller human-written adversarial dataset to a much larger set of synthetic question-answer pairs. By incorporating our synthetic data, we improve the state-of-the-art on the AdversarialQA (https://adversarialqa.github.io/) dataset by 3.7F1 and improve model generalisation on nine of the twelve MRQA datasets. We further conduct a novel human-in-the-loop evaluation to show that our models are considerably more robust to new human-written adversarial examples: crowdworkers can fool our model only 8.8% of the time on average, compared to 17.6% for a model trained without synthetic data.\n\nFor full details on how the dataset was created, kindly refer to the paper.","url":"https://huggingface.co/datasets/mbartolo/synQA","creator_name":"Max Bartolo","creator_url":"https://huggingface.co/mbartolo","license_name":"MIT License","license_url":"https://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/","language":null,"first_N":5,"first_N_keywords":["question-answering","extractive-qa","open-domain-qa","generated","found"],"keywords_longer_than_N":true},

In this paper we explore to what extent machine learning can solve the creative task of the designer. For this, we build a dataset -- LLD -- of 600k+ logos crawled from the world wide web. Training Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for logo synthesis on such multi-modal data is not straightforward and results in mode collapse for some state-of-the-art methods. We propose the use of synthetic labels obtained through clustering to disentangle and stabilize GAN training. We are able to generate a high diversity of plausible logos and we demonstrate latent space exploration techniques to ease the logo design task in an interactive manner. Moreover, we validate the proposed clustered GAN training on CIFAR 10, achieving state-of-the-art Inception scores when using synthetic labels obtained via clustering the features of an ImageNet classifier. GANs can cope with multi-modal data by means of synthetic labels achieved through clustering, and our results show the creative potential of such techniques for logo synthesis and manipulation.","url":"https://huggingface.co/datasets/diwank/lld","creator_name":"Diwank Tomer","creator_url":"https://huggingface.co/diwank","license_name":"MIT License","license_url":"https://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/","language":null,"first_N":5,"first_N_keywords":["monolingual","English","mit","100K<n<1M","🇺🇸 Region: US"],"keywords_longer_than_N":false},
