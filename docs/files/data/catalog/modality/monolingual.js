In the past years, many NLP tasks have\nbeen introduced in this area, with some systems reaching good results on \nEnglish language datasets. Existing AI based approaches for fighting \nmisinformation in literature suggest automatic stance detection as an integral\nfirst step to success. Our paper aims at utilizing this progress made for\nEnglish to transfers that knowledge into other languages, which is a \nnon-trivial task due to the domain gap between English and the target \nlanguages. We propose a black-box non-intrusive method that utilizes techniques\nfrom Domain Adaptation to reduce the domain gap, without requiring any human\nexpertise in the target language, by leveraging low-quality data in both a\nsupervised and unsupervised manner. This allows us to rapidly achieve similar\nresults for stance detection for the Zulu language, the target language in\nthis work, as are found for English.

Potentially idiomatic expressions are like idiomatic expressions, but the term also covers literal uses of idiomatic expressions, such as 'I leave work at the end of the day.' for the idiom 'at the end of the day'. This version of the dataset reflects the filtered subset used by Dankers et al. (2022) in their investigation on how PIEs are represented by NMT models. Authors use 37k samples annotated as fully figurative or literal, for 1482 idioms that contain nouns, numerals or adjectives that are colours (which they refer to as keywords). Because idioms show syntactic and morphological variability, the focus is mostly put on nouns. PIEs and their context are separated using the original corpus’s word-level annotations.","first_N":5,"first_N_keywords":["text-classification","translation","expert-generated","expert-generated","monolingual"],"keywords_longer_than_N":true},

We have generated a manually annotated corpus, where domain experts have labeled a set of scientific literature, clinical trials, and patent abstracts. All the documents were labeled with DeCS descriptors, which is a structured controlled vocabulary created by BIREME to index scientific publications on BvSalud, the largest database of scientific documents in Spanish, which hosts records from the databases LILACS, MEDLINE, IBECS, among others.\n\nMESINESP track at BioASQ9 explores the efficiency of systems for assigning DeCS to different types of biomedical documents. To that purpose, we have divided the task into three subtracks depending on the document type. Then, for each one we generated an annotated corpus which was provided to participating teams:\n\n- [Subtrack 1 corpus] MESINESP-L – Scientific Literature: It contains all   Spanish records from LILACS and IBECS databases at the Virtual Health Library   (VHL) with non-empty abstract written in Spanish.\n- [Subtrack 2 corpus] MESINESP-T- Clinical Trials contains records from Registro   Español de Estudios Clínicos (REEC). REEC doesn't provide documents with the   structure title/abstract needed in BioASQ, for that reason we have built   artificial abstracts based on the content available in the data crawled using   the REEC API.\n- [Subtrack 3 corpus] MESINESP-P – Patents: This corpus includes patents in   Spanish extracted from Google Patents which have the IPC code “A61P” and   “A61K31”. In addition, we also provide a set of complementary data such as:   the DeCS terminology file, a silver standard with the participants' predictions   to the task background set and the entities of medications, diseases, symptoms   and medical procedures extracted from the BSC NERs documents.","first_N":5,"first_N_keywords":["monolingual","Spanish","cc-by-4.0","100K - 1M","Text"],"keywords_longer_than_N":true},

The CodiEsp corpus was selected manually by practicing\nphysicians and clinical documentalists and annotated by clinical coding\nprofessionals meeting strict quality criteria.

All documents are in Spanish language and\nCIE10 is the coding terminology (the Spanish version of ICD10-CM and ICD10-PCS).\nThe CodiEsp corpus has been randomly sampled into three subsets.

In addition to these, a collection of 176,294 abstracts\nfrom Lilacs and Ibecs with the corresponding ICD10 codes (ICD10-CM and\nICD10-PCS) was provided by the task organizers.

We develop a data generation pipeline that selects source passages, identifies candidate answers, generates questions, then finally filters or re-labels them to improve quality. Using this approach, we amplify a smaller human-written adversarial dataset to a much larger set of synthetic question-answer pairs. By incorporating our synthetic data, we improve the state-of-the-art on the AdversarialQA (https://adversarialqa.github.io/) dataset by 3.7F1 and improve model generalisation on nine of the twelve MRQA datasets. We further conduct a novel human-in-the-loop evaluation to show that our models are considerably more robust to new human-written adversarial examples: crowdworkers can fool our model only 8.8% of the time on average, compared to 17.6% for a model trained without synthetic data.\n\nFor full details on how the dataset was created, kindly refer to the paper.","first_N":5,"first_N_keywords":["question-answering","extractive-qa","open-domain-qa","generated","found"],"keywords_longer_than_N":true},

Table annotation is the task of labeling table elements with terms from a given vocabulary. This paper presents the WDC Schema.org Table Annotation Benchmark (SOTAB) for comparing the performance of table annotation systems. SOTAB covers the column type annotation (CTA) and columns property annotation (CPA) tasks. SOTAB provides ∼50,000 annotated tables for each of the tasks containing Schema.org data from different websites. The tables cover 17 different types of entities such as movie, event, local business, recipe, job posting, or product. The tables stem from the WDC Schema.org Table Corpus which was created by extracting Schema.org annotations from the Common Crawl. Consequently, the labels used for annotating columns in SOTAB are part of the Schema.org vocabulary. The benchmark covers 91 types for CTA and 176 properties for CPA distributed across textual, numerical and date/time columns. The tables are split into fixed training, validation and test sets. The test sets are further divided into subsets focusing on specific challenges, such as columns with missing values or different value formats, in order to allow a more fine-grained comparison of annotation systems. The evaluation of SOTAB using Doduo and TURL shows that the benchmark is difficult to solve for current state-of-the-art systems.\n#","first_N":5,"first_N_keywords":["crowdsourced","found","monolingual","original","English"],"keywords_longer_than_N":true},
