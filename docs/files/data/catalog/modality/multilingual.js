	{"name":"super_eurlex","keyword":"multilingual","description":"Super-EURLEX dataset containing legal documents from multiple languages.\n                The datasets are build/scrapped from the EURLEX Website [https://eur-lex.europa.eu/homepage.html]\n                With one split per language and sector, because the available features (metadata) differs for each \n                sector. Therefore, each sample contains the content of a full legal document in up to 3 different \n                formats. Those are raw HTML and cleaned HTML (if the HTML format was available on the EURLEX website \n                during the scrapping process) and cleaned text.\n                The cleaned text should be available for each sample and was extracted from HTML or PDF.\n                'Cleaned' HTML stands here for minor cleaning that was done to preserve to a large extent the necessary \n                HTML information like table structures while removing unnecessary complexity which was introduced to the \n                original documents due to actions like writing each sentence into a new object. \n                Additionally, each sample contains metadata which was scrapped on the fly, this implies the following \n                2 things.

	{"name":"multiconer_v2","keyword":"multilingual","description":"Complex named entities (NE), like the titles of creative works, are not simple nouns and pose challenges for NER systems (Ashwini and Choi, 2014). They can take the form of any linguistic constituent, like an imperative clause (“Dial M for Murder”), and do not look like traditional NEs (Persons, Locations, etc.). This syntactic ambiguity makes it challenging to recognize them based on context. We organized the MultiCoNER task (Malmasi et al., 2022) at SemEval-2022 to address these challenges in 11 languages, receiving a very positive community response with 34 system papers. Results confirmed the challenges of processing complex and long-tail NEs: even the largest pre-trained Transformers did not achieve top performance without external knowledge. The top systems infused transformers with knowledge bases and gazetteers. However, such solutions are brittle against out of knowledge-base entities and noisy scenarios like the presence of spelling mistakes and typos. We propose MultiCoNER II which represents novel challenges through new tasks that emphasize the shortcomings of the current top models.\n\nMultiCoNER II features complex NER in these languages:\n\n1. English\n2. Spanish\n3. Hindi\n4. Bangla\n5. Chinese\n6. Swedish\n7. Farsi\n8. French\n9. Italian\n10. Portugese\n11. Ukranian\n12.

	{"name":"xCodeEval","keyword":"multilingual","description":"The ability to solve problems is a hallmark of intelligence and has been an enduring goal in AI. AI systems that can create programs as solutions to problems or assist developers in writing programs can increase productivity and make programming more accessible. Recently, pre-trained large language models have shown impressive abilities in generating new codes from natural language descriptions, repairing buggy codes, translating codes between languages, and retrieving relevant code segments. However, the evaluation of these models has often been performed in a scattered way on only one or two specific tasks, in a few languages, at a partial granularity (e.g., function) level and in many cases without proper training data. Even more concerning is that in most cases the evaluation of generated codes has been done in terms of mere lexical overlap rather than actual execution whereas semantic similarity (or equivalence) of two code segments depends only on their ``execution similarity'', i.e., being able to get the same output for a given input.","url":"https://huggingface.co/datasets/NTU-NLP-sg/xCodeEval","creator_name":"NLP Group of Nanyang Technological University","creator_url":"https://huggingface.co/NTU-NLP-sg","license_name":"Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International Public License","license_url":"https://choosealicense.com/licenses/cc-by-4.0/","language":null,"first_N":5,"first_N_keywords":["translation","token-classification","text-retrieval","text-generation","text-classification"],"keywords_longer_than_N":true},
