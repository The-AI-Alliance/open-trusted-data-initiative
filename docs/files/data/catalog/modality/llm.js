The dataset is also complemented by an Online Analytics Platform that not only allows users to view hurricane-related posts and articles, but also explores high-frequency keywords, user sentiment, and the locations where posts were made. To our best knowledge, MASH is the first large-scale, multi-platform, multimodal, and multi-dimensionally annotated hurricane dataset.
