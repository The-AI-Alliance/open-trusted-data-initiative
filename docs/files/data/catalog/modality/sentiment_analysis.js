Our paper aims at utilizing this progress made for\nEnglish to transfers that knowledge into other languages, which is a \nnon-trivial task due to the domain gap between English and the target \nlanguages. We propose a black-box non-intrusive method that utilizes techniques\nfrom Domain Adaptation to reduce the domain gap, without requiring any human\nexpertise in the target language, by leveraging low-quality data in both a\nsupervised and unsupervised manner. This allows us to rapidly achieve similar\nresults for stance detection for the Zulu language, the target language in\nthis work, as are found for English.
