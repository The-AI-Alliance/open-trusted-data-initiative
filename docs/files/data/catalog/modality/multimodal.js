In addition, all relevant posts are annotated on three dimensions: Humanitarian Classes, Bias Classes, and Information Integrity Classes in a multi-modal approach that considers both textual and visual content, providing a rich labeled dataset for in-depth analysis. The dataset is also complemented by an Online Analytics Platform that not only allows users to view hurricane-related posts and articles, but also explores high-frequency keywords, user sentiment, and the locations where posts were made. To our best knowledge, MASH is the first large-scale, multi-platform, multimodal, and multi-dimensionally annotated hurricane dataset.  We envision that MASH can contribute to the study of hurricanes' impact on society, such as disaster severity classification, event detections, public sentiment analysis, and bias identification.\n","first_N":5,"first_N_keywords":["text-classification","image-classification","video-classification","expert-annotated","LLM"],"keywords_longer_than_N":true},
