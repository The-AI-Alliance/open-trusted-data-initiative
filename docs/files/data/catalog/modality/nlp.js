For this, we develop the first corpus of business process descriptions annotated with activities, gateways, actors and flow information. We present our new resource, including a detailed overview of the annotation schema and guidelines, as well as a variety of baselines to benchmark the difficulty and challenges of business process extraction from text.","url":"https://huggingface.co/datasets/patriziobellan/PET","creator_name":"Patrizio Bellan","creator_url":"https://huggingface.co/patriziobellan","license_name":"MIT License","license_url":"https://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/","language":null,"first_N":5,"first_N_keywords":["token-classification","English","mit","n<1K","arxiv:2203.04860"],"keywords_longer_than_N":true},
