Other words are considered to be auxiliary (in current implementation\nit is marked by `True` value of `\"is_unknown\"` feature). Their function is to teach a model to distinguish core words\nfrom unrecognized ones.\nThis version is not yet supported.\n\nThe `_silence_` class contains a set of longer audio clips that are either recordings or\na mathematical simulation of noise.","url":"https://huggingface.co/datasets/renumics/speech_commands_enriched","creator_name":"Renumics","creator_url":"https://huggingface.co/renumics","license_name":"Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International Public License","license_url":"https://choosealicense.com/licenses/cc-by-4.0/","language":"en","first_N":5,"first_N_keywords":["audio-classification","keyword-spotting","other","crowdsourced","monolingual"],"keywords_longer_than_N":true},

	{"name":"SOTAB","keyword":"crowdsourced","description":"# Understanding the semantics of table elements is a prerequisite for many data integration and data discovery tasks. Table annotation is the task of labeling table elements with terms from a given vocabulary. This paper presents the WDC Schema.org Table Annotation Benchmark (SOTAB) for comparing the performance of table annotation systems. SOTAB covers the column type annotation (CTA) and columns property annotation (CPA) tasks. SOTAB provides ∼50,000 annotated tables for each of the tasks containing Schema.org data from different websites. The tables cover 17 different types of entities such as movie, event, local business, recipe, job posting, or product. The tables stem from the WDC Schema.org Table Corpus which was created by extracting Schema.org annotations from the Common Crawl. Consequently, the labels used for annotating columns in SOTAB are part of the Schema.org vocabulary. The benchmark covers 91 types for CTA and 176 properties for CPA distributed across textual, numerical and date/time columns. The tables are split into fixed training, validation and test sets. The test sets are further divided into subsets focusing on specific challenges, such as columns with missing values or different value formats, in order to allow a more fine-grained comparison of annotation systems. The evaluation of SOTAB using Doduo and TURL shows that the benchmark is difficult to solve for current state-of-the-art systems.\n#","url":"https://huggingface.co/datasets/shivangibithel/SOTAB","creator_name":"Shivangi Bithel","creator_url":"https://huggingface.co/shivangibithel","license_name":"Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International Public License","license_url":"https://choosealicense.com/licenses/cc-by-4.0/","language":"en","first_N":5,"first_N_keywords":["crowdsourced","found","monolingual","original","English"],"keywords_longer_than_N":true},
