Typically, Passage ranking involves two stages: passage… See the full description on the dataset page: https://huggingface.co/datasets/THUIR/T2Ranking.","url":"https://huggingface.co/datasets/THUIR/T2Ranking","creator_name":"THUIR","creator_url":"https://huggingface.co/THUIR","license_name":"Apache License 2.0","license_url":"https://choosealicense.com/licenses/apache-2.0/","language":null,"first_N":5,"first_N_keywords":["text-retrieval","text-classification","sentence-similarity","Chinese","apache-2.0"],"keywords_longer_than_N":true},

In the past years, many NLP tasks have\nbeen introduced in this area, with some systems reaching good results on \nEnglish language datasets. Existing AI based approaches for fighting \nmisinformation in literature suggest automatic stance detection as an integral\nfirst step to success. Our paper aims at utilizing this progress made for\nEnglish to transfers that knowledge into other languages, which is a \nnon-trivial task due to the domain gap between English and the target \nlanguages. We propose a black-box non-intrusive method that utilizes techniques\nfrom Domain Adaptation to reduce the domain gap, without requiring any human\nexpertise in the target language, by leveraging low-quality data in both a\nsupervised and unsupervised manner. This allows us to rapidly achieve similar\nresults for stance detection for the Zulu language, the target language in\nthis work, as are found for English.

	{"name":"xCodeEval","keyword":"text-retrieval","description":"The ability to solve problems is a hallmark of intelligence and has been an enduring goal in AI. AI systems that can create programs as solutions to problems or assist developers in writing programs can increase productivity and make programming more accessible. Recently, pre-trained large language models have shown impressive abilities in generating new codes from natural language descriptions, repairing buggy codes, translating codes between languages, and retrieving relevant code segments. However, the evaluation of these models has often been performed in a scattered way on only one or two specific tasks, in a few languages, at a partial granularity (e.g., function) level and in many cases without proper training data. Even more concerning is that in most cases the evaluation of generated codes has been done in terms of mere lexical overlap rather than actual execution whereas semantic similarity (or equivalence) of two code segments depends only on their ``execution similarity'', i.e., being able to get the same output for a given input.","url":"https://huggingface.co/datasets/NTU-NLP-sg/xCodeEval","creator_name":"NLP Group of Nanyang Technological University","creator_url":"https://huggingface.co/NTU-NLP-sg","license_name":"Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International Public License","license_url":"https://choosealicense.com/licenses/cc-by-4.0/","language":null,"first_N":5,"first_N_keywords":["translation","token-classification","text-retrieval","text-generation","text-classification"],"keywords_longer_than_N":true},
