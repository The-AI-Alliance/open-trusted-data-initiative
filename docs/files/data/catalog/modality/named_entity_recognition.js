In this paper we describe the process and challenges of simultaneouslydevelopingmultiple linguistic resources for ten of the official languages of South Africa. The project focussed on establishing a set of foundational resources that can foster further development of both resources and technologies for the NLP industry in South Africa. The development efforts during the project included creating monolingual unannotated corpora, of which a subset of the corpora for each language was annotated on token, orthographic, morphological and morphosyntactic layers. The annotated subsetsincludes both development and test setsand were used in the creation of five core-technologies, viz. atokeniser, sentenciser,lemmatiser, part of speech tagger and morphological decomposer for each language. We report on the quality of these tools for each language and provide some more context of the importance of the resources within the South African context.","url":"https://huggingface.co/datasets/nwu-ctext/nchlt","creator_name":"Centre for Text Technology - Humanities - NWU","creator_url":"https://huggingface.co/nwu-ctext","license_name":"Creative Commons Attribution 2.5","license_url":"https://scancode-licensedb.aboutcode.org/cc-by-2.5.html","language":null,"first_N":5,"first_N_keywords":["token-classification","named-entity-recognition","expert-generated","expert-generated","multilingual"],"keywords_longer_than_N":true},

The texts were obtained from\nHausa Voice of America News articles https://www.voahausa.com/ . We concentrate on\nfour types of named entities: persons [PER], locations [LOC], organizations [ORG], and dates & time [DATE].\n\nThe Hausa VOA NER data files contain 2 columns separated by a tab ('\\t'). Each word has been put on a separate line and\nthere is an empty line after each sentences i.e the CoNLL format. The first item on each line is a word, the second\nis the named entity tag. The named entity tags have the format I-TYPE which means that the word is inside a phrase\nof type TYPE. For every multi-word expression like 'New York', the first word gets a tag B-TYPE and the subsequent words\nhave tags I-TYPE, a word with tag O is not part of a phrase. The dataset is in the BIO tagging scheme.\n\nFor more details, see https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/2020.emnlp-main.204/","url":"https://huggingface.co/datasets/UdS-LSV/hausa_voa_ner","creator_name":"LSV @ Saarland University","creator_url":"https://huggingface.co/UdS-LSV","license_name":"Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International Public License","license_url":"https://choosealicense.com/licenses/cc-by-4.0/","language":null,"first_N":5,"first_N_keywords":["token-classification","named-entity-recognition","expert-generated","expert-generated","monolingual"],"keywords_longer_than_N":true},

The software components, the training data and all data used for feature generation are distributed under permissive licenses, thus this tagger can be used in academic and commercial settings without restrictions or fees.
