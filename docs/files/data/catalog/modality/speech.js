Breaking domain names such as \"openresearch\" into component words \"open\" and \"research\" is important for applications such as Text-to-Speech synthesis and web search. Common Crawl is an open repository of web crawl data that can be accessed and analyzed by anyone. Specifically, we scraped the plaintext (WET) extracts for domain names from URLs that contained diverse letter casing (e.g. \"OpenBSD\"). Although in the previous example, segmentation is trivial using letter casing, this was not always the case (e.g. \"NASA\"), so we had to manually annotate the data. The dataset is stored as plaintext file where each line is an example of space separated segments of a domain name. The examples are stored in their original letter casing, but harder and more interesting examples can be generated by lowercasing the input first.","url":"https://huggingface.co/datasets/google-research-datasets/crawl_domain","creator_name":"Google Research Datasets","creator_url":"https://huggingface.co/google-research-datasets","license_name":"MIT License","license_url":"https://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/","language":null,"first_N":5,"first_N_keywords":["other","expert-generated","crowdsourced","expert-generated","found"],"keywords_longer_than_N":true},

These talks are orthographically transcribed to either Norwegian Bokmål or Norwegian Nynorsk. In addition to the data actually included in this dataset, there is a significant amount of metadata that is included in the original corpus. Through the speaker id there is additional information about the speaker, like gender, age, and place of birth (ie dialect). Through the proceedings id the corpus can be linked to the official proceedings from the meetings.\n\nThe corpus is in total sound recordings from 40 entire days of meetings. This amounts to 140 hours of speech, 65,000 sentences or 1.2 million words.\n\nThis dataset builds on this corpus. In addition it adds two columns with machine generated orthographic text.","url":"https://huggingface.co/datasets/NbAiLab/NPSC_orto","creator_name":"Nasjonalbiblioteket AI Lab","creator_url":"https://huggingface.co/NbAiLab","license_name":"Creative Commons Zero v1.0 Universal","license_url":"https://choosealicense.com/licenses/cc0-1.0/","language":null,"first_N":5,"first_N_keywords":["automatic-speech-recognition","audio-classification","no-annotation","found","monolingual"],"keywords_longer_than_N":true},
