In this work, we introduce the FLORES evaluation benchmark, consisting of 3001 \\nsentences extracted from English Wikipedia and covering a variety of different topics and domains. \\nThese sentences have been translated in 101 languages by professional translators through a carefully \\ncontrolled process. The resulting dataset enables better assessment of model quality on the long tail of \\nlow-resource languages, including the evaluation of many-to-many multilingual translation systems, as all \\ntranslations are multilingually aligned.

The data is translated to Zulu by Zulu native speakers, from English source texts.\\n\\nMisinformation has become a major concern in recent last years given its \\nspread across our information sources. In the past years, many NLP tasks have\\nbeen introduced in this area, with some systems reaching good results on \\nEnglish language datasets. Existing AI based approaches for fighting \\nmisinformation in literature suggest automatic stance detection as an integral\\nfirst step to success. Our paper aims at utilizing this progress made for\\nEnglish to transfers that knowledge into other languages, which is a \\nnon-trivial task due to the domain gap between English and the target \\nlanguages. We propose a black-box non-intrusive method that utilizes techniques\\nfrom Domain Adaptation to reduce the domain gap, without requiring any human\\nexpertise in the target language, by leveraging low-quality data in both a\\nsupervised and unsupervised manner. This allows us to rapidly achieve similar\\nresults for stance detection for the Zulu language, the target language in\\nthis work, as are found for English. We also provide a stance detection dataset\\nin the Zulu language."},

In this work, we introduce the FLORES evaluation benchmark, consisting of 3001 \\nsentences extracted from English Wikipedia and covering a variety of different topics and domains. \\nThese sentences have been translated in 101 languages by professional translators through a carefully \\ncontrolled process. The resulting dataset enables better assessment of model quality on the long tail of \\nlow-resource languages, including the evaluation of many-to-many multilingual translation systems, as all \\ntranslations are multilingually aligned.
