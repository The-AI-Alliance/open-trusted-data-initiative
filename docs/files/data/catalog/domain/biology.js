Despite the availability of \nvarious open-source LLMs tailored for health contexts, adapting \ngeneral-purpose LLMs to the medical domain presents significant\nchallenges. In this paper, we introduce BioMistral, an open-source\nLLM tailored for the biomedical domain, utilizing Mistral as its \nfoundation model and further pre-trained on PubMed Central. We conduct \na comprehensive evaluation of BioMistral on a benchmark comprising 10 \nestablished medical question-answering (QA) tasks in English. We also \nexplore lightweight models obtained through quantization and model \nmerging approaches. Our results demonstrate BioMistral's superior \nperformance compared to existing open-source medical models and its \ncompetitive edge against proprietary counterparts. Finally, to address \nthe limited availability of data beyond English and to assess the multilingual \ngeneralization of medical LLMs, we automatically translated and evaluated this\nbenchmark into 7 other languages. This marks the first large-scale\nmultilingual evaluation of LLMs in the medical domain.
