Each recording was made by playing and holding a musical note for three seconds and letting it decay for one second. The collection of four-second recordings ranges over every pitch on a standard MIDI piano (or as many as possible for the given instrument), played at five different velocities.\nThis dataset was created as an attempt to establish a high-quality entry point into audio machine learning, in response to the surge of breakthroughs in generative modeling of images due to the abundance of approachable image datasets (MNIST, CIFAR, ImageNet). NSynth is meant to be both a benchmark for audio ML and a foundation to be expanded on with future datasets.","url":"https://huggingface.co/datasets/jg583/NSynth","creator_name":"John Gillen","creator_url":"https://huggingface.co/jg583","license_name":"Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International Public License","license_url":"https://choosealicense.com/licenses/cc-by-4.0/","language":null,"first_N":5,"first_N_keywords":["audio-to-audio","audio-classification","cc-by-4.0","100K<n<1M","arxiv:1704.01279"],"keywords_longer_than_N":true},
