First, lists of 11 typical grammatical structures with syntactic \nhomonymy (mainly case) are compiled. For example, two noun phrases with a \ncomplex subordinate: 'A trinket from Pompeii that has survived the centuries'.\nRequests corresponding to these constructions are submitted in search of the \nRussian National Corpus, or rather its sub-corpus with removed homonymy. In the \nresulting 2+k examples, homonymy is removed automatically with manual validation\nafterward. Each original sentence is split into multiple examples in the binary \nclassification format, indicating whether the homonymy is resolved correctly or\nnot.","url":"https://huggingface.co/datasets/RussianNLP/tape","creator_name":"Natural Language Processing in Russian","creator_url":"https://huggingface.co/RussianNLP","license_name":"Apache License 2.0","license_url":"https://choosealicense.com/licenses/apache-2.0/","language":null,"first_N":5,"first_N_keywords":["text-classification","question-answering","multiple-choice","Russian","apache-2.0"],"keywords_longer_than_N":true},
