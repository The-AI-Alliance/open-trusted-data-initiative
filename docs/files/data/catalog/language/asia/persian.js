They can take the form of any linguistic constituent, like an imperative clause (“Dial M for Murder”), and do not look like traditional NEs (Persons, Locations, etc.). This syntactic ambiguity makes it challenging to recognize them based on context. We organized the MultiCoNER task (Malmasi et al., 2022) at SemEval-2022 to address these challenges in 11 languages, receiving a very positive community response with 34 system papers. Results confirmed the challenges of processing complex and long-tail NEs: even the largest pre-trained Transformers did not achieve top performance without external knowledge. The top systems infused transformers with knowledge bases and gazetteers. However, such solutions are brittle against out of knowledge-base entities and noisy scenarios like the presence of spelling mistakes and typos. We propose MultiCoNER II which represents novel challenges through new tasks that emphasize the shortcomings of the current top models.\\n\\nMultiCoNER II features complex NER in these languages:\\n\\n1.

In this work, we introduce the FLORES evaluation benchmark, consisting of 3001 \\nsentences extracted from English Wikipedia and covering a variety of different topics and domains. \\nThese sentences have been translated in 101 languages by professional translators through a carefully \\ncontrolled process. The resulting dataset enables better assessment of model quality on the long tail of \\nlow-resource languages, including the evaluation of many-to-many multilingual translation systems, as all \\ntranslations are multilingually aligned.

This dataset is designed to represent contemporary challenges in NER, including low-context scenarios (short and uncased text), syntactically complex entities like movie titles, and long-tail entity distributions. The 26M token dataset is compiled from public resources using techniques such as heuristic-based sentence sampling, template extraction and slotting, and machine translation. We applied two NER models on our dataset: a baseline XLM-RoBERTa model, and a state-of-the-art GEMNET model that leverages gazetteers. The baseline achieves moderate performance (macro-F1=54%), highlighting the difficulty of our data. GEMNET, which uses gazetteers, improvement significantly (average improvement of macro-F1=+30%). MultiCoNER poses challenges even for large pre-trained language models, and we believe that it can help further research in building robust NER systems.
