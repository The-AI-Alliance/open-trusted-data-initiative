The 26M token dataset is compiled from public resources using techniques such as heuristic-based sentence sampling, template extraction and slotting, and machine translation. We applied two NER models on our dataset: a baseline XLM-RoBERTa model, and a state-of-the-art GEMNET model that leverages gazetteers. The baseline achieves moderate performance (macro-F1=54%), highlighting the difficulty of our data. GEMNET, which uses gazetteers, improvement significantly (average improvement of macro-F1=+30%). MultiCoNER poses challenges even for large pre-trained language models, and we believe that it can help further research in building robust NER systems.

The dataset provides paired recordings from 60 native Korean… See the full description on the dataset page: https://huggingface.co/datasets/yskim3271/Throat_and_Acoustic_Pairing_Speech_Dataset.","url":"https://huggingface.co/datasets/yskim3271/Throat_and_Acoustic_Pairing_Speech_Dataset","creator_name":"yunsik kim","creator_url":"https://huggingface.co/yskim3271","license_name":"Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International Public License","license_url":"https://choosealicense.com/licenses/cc-by-4.0/","language":"en","first_N":5,"first_N_keywords":["Korean","cc-by-4.0","1K - 10K","parquet","Audio"],"keywords_longer_than_N":true},
