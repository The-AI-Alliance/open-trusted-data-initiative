The resulting dataset enables better assessment of model quality on the long tail of \\nlow-resource languages, including the evaluation of many-to-many multilingual translation systems, as all \\ntranslations are multilingually aligned.

Current evaluation benchmarks either lack good coverage of low-resource \\nlanguages, consider only restricted domains, or are low quality because they are constructed using \\nsemi-automatic procedures. In this work, we introduce the FLORES evaluation benchmark, consisting of 3001 \\nsentences extracted from English Wikipedia and covering a variety of different topics and domains. \\nThese sentences have been translated in 101 languages by professional translators through a carefully \\ncontrolled process. The resulting dataset enables better assessment of model quality on the long tail of \\nlow-resource languages, including the evaluation of many-to-many multilingual translation systems, as all \\ntranslations are multilingually aligned. By publicly releasing such a high-quality and high-coverage dataset, \\nwe hope to foster progress in the machine translation community and beyond."},
