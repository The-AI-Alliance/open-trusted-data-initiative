It can be used for automatic text simplification as well as translating simple Japanese into English and vice-versa. The core vocabulary is restricted to 2,000 words where it is selected by accounting for several factors such as meaning preservation, variation, simplicity and the UniDic word segmentation criterion.\nFor details, refer to the explanation page of Japanese simplification (http://www.jnlp.org/research/Japanese_simplification).
