Second, we propose RED\\textsuperscript{FM}, a smaller, human-revised dataset for seven languages that allows for the evaluation of multilingual RE systems. \nTo demonstrate the utility of these novel datasets, we experiment with the first end-to-end multilingual RE model, mREBEL, \nthat extracts triplets, including entity types, in multiple languages.
