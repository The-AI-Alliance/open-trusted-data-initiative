In contrast to the standard DA (sliding scale from 0-100) used in previous years, in 2022 annotators performed DA+SQM (Direct Assessment + Scalar Quality Metric). In DA+SQM, the annotators still provide a raw score between 0 and 100, but also are presented with seven labeled tick marks. DA+SQM helps to stabilize scores across annotators (as compared to DA).\nThe data is… See the full description on the dataset page: https://huggingface.co/datasets/RicardoRei/wmt-sqm-human-evaluation.","first_N":5,"first_N_keywords":["Czech","German","English","Croatian","Japanese"],"keywords_longer_than_N":true},
