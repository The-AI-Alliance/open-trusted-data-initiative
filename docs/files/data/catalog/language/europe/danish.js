In this work, we introduce the FLORES evaluation benchmark, consisting of 3001 \\nsentences extracted from English Wikipedia and covering a variety of different topics and domains. \\nThese sentences have been translated in 101 languages by professional translators through a carefully \\ncontrolled process. The resulting dataset enables better assessment of model quality on the long tail of \\nlow-resource languages, including the evaluation of many-to-many multilingual translation systems, as all \\ntranslations are multilingually aligned.

All samples come from the Natural Questions (NQ) dataset, which is a large\\nquestion answering dataset from Google searches. The Scandinavian questions and answers\\ncome from the MKQA dataset, where 10,000 NQ samples were manually translated into,\\namong others, Danish, Norwegian, and Swedish. However, this did not include a\\ntranslated context, hindering the training of extractive question answering models.\\n\\nWe merged the NQ dataset with the MKQA dataset, and extracted contexts as either \\\"long\\nanswers\\\" from the NQ dataset, being the paragraph in which the answer was found, or\\notherwise we extract the context by locating the paragraphs which have the largest\\ncosine similarity to the question, and which contains the desired answer.\\n\\nFurther, many answers in the MKQA dataset were \\\"language normalised\\\": for instance, all\\ndate answers were converted to the format \\\"YYYY-MM-DD\\\", meaning that in most cases\\nthese answers are not appearing in any paragraphs. We solve this by extending the MKQA\\nanswers with plausible \\\"answer candidates\\\", being slight perturbations or translations\\nof the answer.\\n\\nWith the contexts extracted, we translated these to Danish, Swedish and Norwegian using\\nthe DeepL translation service for Danish and Swedish, and the Google Translation\\nservice for Norwegian. After translation we ensured that the Scandinavian answers do\\nindeed occur in the translated contexts.\\n\\nAs we are filtering the MKQA samples at both the \\\"merging stage\\\" and the \\\"translation\\nstage\\\", we are not able to fully convert the 10,000 samples to the Scandinavian\\nlanguages, and instead get roughly 8,000 samples per language. These have further been\\nsplit into a training, validation and test split, with the former two containing\\nroughly 750 samples. The splits have been created in such a way that the proportion of\\nsamples without an answer is roughly the same in each split."},

Current evaluation benchmarks either lack good coverage of low-resource \\nlanguages, consider only restricted domains, or are low quality because they are constructed using \\nsemi-automatic procedures. In this work, we introduce the FLORES evaluation benchmark, consisting of 3001 \\nsentences extracted from English Wikipedia and covering a variety of different topics and domains. \\nThese sentences have been translated in 101 languages by professional translators through a carefully \\ncontrolled process. The resulting dataset enables better assessment of model quality on the long tail of \\nlow-resource languages, including the evaluation of many-to-many multilingual translation systems, as all \\ntranslations are multilingually aligned. By publicly releasing such a high-quality and high-coverage dataset, \\nwe hope to foster progress in the machine translation community and beyond."},
