The CodiEsp corpus was selected manually by practicing\nphysicians and clinical documentalists and annotated by clinical coding\nprofessionals meeting strict quality criteria. They reached an inter-annotator\nagreement of 88.6% for diagnosis coding, 88.9% for procedure coding and 80.5%\nfor the textual reference annotation.\n\nThe final collection of 1,000 clinical cases that make up the corpus had a total\nof 16,504 sentences and 396,988 words. All documents are in Spanish language and\nCIE10 is the coding terminology (the Spanish version of ICD10-CM and ICD10-PCS).\nThe CodiEsp corpus has been randomly sampled into three subsets. The train set\ncontains 500 clinical cases, while the development and test sets have 250\nclinical cases each. In addition to these, a collection of 176,294 abstracts\nfrom Lilacs and Ibecs with the corresponding ICD10 codes (ICD10-CM and\nICD10-PCS) was provided by the task organizers. Every abstract has at least one\nassociated code, with an average of 2.5 ICD10 codes per abstract.\n\nThe CodiEsp track was divided into three sub-tracks (2 main and 1 exploratory):\n\n- CodiEsp-D: The Diagnosis Coding sub-task, which requires automatic ICD10-CM\n  [CIE10-Diagnóstico] code assignment.\n- CodiEsp-P: The Procedure Coding sub-task, which requires automatic ICD10-PCS\n  [CIE10-Procedimiento] code assignment.\n- CodiEsp-X: The Explainable AI exploratory sub-task, which requires to submit\n  the reference to the predicted codes (both ICD10-CM and ICD10-PCS).

This dataset is designed to represent contemporary challenges in NER, including low-context scenarios (short and uncased text), syntactically complex entities like movie titles, and long-tail entity distributions. The 26M token dataset is compiled from public resources using techniques such as heuristic-based sentence sampling, template extraction and slotting, and machine translation. We applied two NER models on our dataset: a baseline XLM-RoBERTa model, and a state-of-the-art GEMNET model that leverages gazetteers. The baseline achieves moderate performance (macro-F1=54%), highlighting the difficulty of our data. GEMNET, which uses gazetteers, improvement significantly (average improvement of macro-F1=+30%). MultiCoNER poses challenges even for large pre-trained language models, and we believe that it can help further research in building robust NER systems.

In this paper, we introduce BioMistral, an open-source\nLLM tailored for the biomedical domain, utilizing Mistral as its \nfoundation model and further pre-trained on PubMed Central. We conduct \na comprehensive evaluation of BioMistral on a benchmark comprising 10 \nestablished medical question-answering (QA) tasks in English.

Our results demonstrate BioMistral's superior \nperformance compared to existing open-source medical models and its \ncompetitive edge against proprietary counterparts. Finally, to address \nthe limited availability of data beyond English and to assess the multilingual \ngeneralization of medical LLMs, we automatically translated and evaluated this\nbenchmark into 7 other languages.

	{"name":"multiconer_v2","keyword":"spanish","description":"Complex named entities (NE), like the titles of creative works, are not simple nouns and pose challenges for NER systems (Ashwini and Choi, 2014). They can take the form of any linguistic constituent, like an imperative clause (“Dial M for Murder”), and do not look like traditional NEs (Persons, Locations, etc.). This syntactic ambiguity makes it challenging to recognize them based on context. We organized the MultiCoNER task (Malmasi et al., 2022) at SemEval-2022 to address these challenges in 11 languages, receiving a very positive community response with 34 system papers. Results confirmed the challenges of processing complex and long-tail NEs: even the largest pre-trained Transformers did not achieve top performance without external knowledge. The top systems infused transformers with knowledge bases and gazetteers. However, such solutions are brittle against out of knowledge-base entities and noisy scenarios like the presence of spelling mistakes and typos. We propose MultiCoNER II which represents novel challenges through new tasks that emphasize the shortcomings of the current top models.\n\nMultiCoNER II features complex NER in these languages:\n\n1. English\n2. Spanish\n3. Hindi\n4. Bangla\n5. Chinese\n6. Swedish\n7. Farsi\n8. French\n9. Italian\n10. Portugese\n11. Ukranian\n12.
