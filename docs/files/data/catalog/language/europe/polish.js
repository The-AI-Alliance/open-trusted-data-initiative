Second, we propose RED\\textsuperscript{FM}, a smaller, human-revised dataset for seven languages that allows for the evaluation of multilingual RE systems. \nTo demonstrate the utility of these novel datasets, we experiment with the first end-to-end multilingual RE model, mREBEL, \nthat extracts triplets, including entity types, in multiple languages.

In this work, we introduce the FLORES evaluation benchmark, consisting of 3001 \nsentences extracted from English Wikipedia and covering a variety of different topics and domains. \nThese sentences have been translated in 101 languages by professional translators through a carefully \ncontrolled process. The resulting dataset enables better assessment of model quality on the long tail of \nlow-resource languages, including the evaluation of many-to-many multilingual translation systems, as all \ntranslations are multilingually aligned.
