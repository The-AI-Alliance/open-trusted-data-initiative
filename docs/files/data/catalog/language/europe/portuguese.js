Despite the availability of \nvarious open-source LLMs tailored for health contexts, adapting \ngeneral-purpose LLMs to the medical domain presents significant\nchallenges. In this paper, we introduce BioMistral, an open-source\nLLM tailored for the biomedical domain, utilizing Mistral as its \nfoundation model and further pre-trained on PubMed Central. We conduct \na comprehensive evaluation of BioMistral on a benchmark comprising 10 \nestablished medical question-answering (QA) tasks in English. We also \nexplore lightweight models obtained through quantization and model \nmerging approaches. Our results demonstrate BioMistral's superior \nperformance compared to existing open-source medical models and its \ncompetitive edge against proprietary counterparts. Finally, to address \nthe limited availability of data beyond English and to assess the multilingual \ngeneralization of medical LLMs, we automatically translated and evaluated this\nbenchmark into 7 other languages. This marks the first large-scale\nmultilingual evaluation of LLMs in the medical domain.

	{"name":"multiconer_v2","keyword":"portuguese","description":"Complex named entities (NE), like the titles of creative works, are not simple nouns and pose challenges for NER systems (Ashwini and Choi, 2014). They can take the form of any linguistic constituent, like an imperative clause (“Dial M for Murder”), and do not look like traditional NEs (Persons, Locations, etc.). This syntactic ambiguity makes it challenging to recognize them based on context. We organized the MultiCoNER task (Malmasi et al., 2022) at SemEval-2022 to address these challenges in 11 languages, receiving a very positive community response with 34 system papers. Results confirmed the challenges of processing complex and long-tail NEs: even the largest pre-trained Transformers did not achieve top performance without external knowledge. The top systems infused transformers with knowledge bases and gazetteers. However, such solutions are brittle against out of knowledge-base entities and noisy scenarios like the presence of spelling mistakes and typos. We propose MultiCoNER II which represents novel challenges through new tasks that emphasize the shortcomings of the current top models.\n\nMultiCoNER II features complex NER in these languages:\n\n1.
