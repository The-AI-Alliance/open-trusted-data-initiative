It consists of 372 tables of data in tsv format for each year of publication from 1600 to 1996 (all the missing years are in the 17th and 20th centuries). Each table is structured at the page-level of each novel (5,723,986 pages in all). It contains the complete text with the addition of some metadata. It can be opened in Excel or, preferably, with the new data analysis environments in R or Python (tidyverse, pandas…)\n\nThis corpus can be used for large-scale quantitative analyses in computational humanities. The OCR text is presented in a raw format without any correction or enrichment in order to be directly processed for text mining purposes.\n\nThe extraction is based on a historical categorization of the novels: the Y2 or Ybis classification. This classification, invented in 1730, is the only one that has been continuously applied to the BNF collections now available in the public domain (mainly before 1950). Consequently, the dataset is based on a definition of \"novel\" that is generally contemporary of the publication.\n\nA French data paper (in PDF and HTML) presents the construction process of the Y2 category and describes the structuring of the corpus. It also gives several examples of possible uses for computational humanities projects.","url":"https://huggingface.co/datasets/biglam/gallica_literary_fictions","creator_name":"BigLAM: BigScience Libraries, Archives and Museums","creator_url":"https://huggingface.co/biglam","license_name":"Creative Commons Zero v1.0 Universal","license_url":"https://choosealicense.com/licenses/cc0-1.0/","language":null,"first_N":5,"first_N_keywords":["text-generation","language-modeling","monolingual","original","French"],"keywords_longer_than_N":true},

Therefore, each sample contains the content of a full legal document in up to 3 different \n                formats. Those are raw HTML and cleaned HTML (if the HTML format was available on the EURLEX website \n                during the scrapping process) and cleaned text.\n                The cleaned text should be available for each sample and was extracted from HTML or PDF.\n                'Cleaned' HTML stands here for minor cleaning that was done to preserve to a large extent the necessary \n                HTML information like table structures while removing unnecessary complexity which was introduced to the \n                original documents due to actions like writing each sentence into a new object. \n                Additionally, each sample contains metadata which was scrapped on the fly, this implies the following \n                2 things.

Despite the availability of \nvarious open-source LLMs tailored for health contexts, adapting \ngeneral-purpose LLMs to the medical domain presents significant\nchallenges. In this paper, we introduce BioMistral, an open-source\nLLM tailored for the biomedical domain, utilizing Mistral as its \nfoundation model and further pre-trained on PubMed Central. We conduct \na comprehensive evaluation of BioMistral on a benchmark comprising 10 \nestablished medical question-answering (QA) tasks in English. We also \nexplore lightweight models obtained through quantization and model \nmerging approaches. Our results demonstrate BioMistral's superior \nperformance compared to existing open-source medical models and its \ncompetitive edge against proprietary counterparts. Finally, to address \nthe limited availability of data beyond English and to assess the multilingual \ngeneralization of medical LLMs, we automatically translated and evaluated this\nbenchmark into 7 other languages. This marks the first large-scale\nmultilingual evaluation of LLMs in the medical domain.

	{"name":"multiconer_v2","keyword":"french","description":"Complex named entities (NE), like the titles of creative works, are not simple nouns and pose challenges for NER systems (Ashwini and Choi, 2014). They can take the form of any linguistic constituent, like an imperative clause (“Dial M for Murder”), and do not look like traditional NEs (Persons, Locations, etc.). This syntactic ambiguity makes it challenging to recognize them based on context. We organized the MultiCoNER task (Malmasi et al., 2022) at SemEval-2022 to address these challenges in 11 languages, receiving a very positive community response with 34 system papers. Results confirmed the challenges of processing complex and long-tail NEs: even the largest pre-trained Transformers did not achieve top performance without external knowledge. The top systems infused transformers with knowledge bases and gazetteers. However, such solutions are brittle against out of knowledge-base entities and noisy scenarios like the presence of spelling mistakes and typos. We propose MultiCoNER II which represents novel challenges through new tasks that emphasize the shortcomings of the current top models.\n\nMultiCoNER II features complex NER in these languages:\n\n1.
