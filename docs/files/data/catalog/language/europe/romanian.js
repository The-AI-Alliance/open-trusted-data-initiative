Current evaluation benchmarks either lack good coverage of low-resource \nlanguages, consider only restricted domains, or are low quality because they are constructed using \nsemi-automatic procedures. In this work, we introduce the FLORES evaluation benchmark, consisting of 3001 \nsentences extracted from English Wikipedia and covering a variety of different topics and domains. \nThese sentences have been translated in 101 languages by professional translators through a carefully \ncontrolled process. The resulting dataset enables better assessment of model quality on the long tail of \nlow-resource languages, including the evaluation of many-to-many multilingual translation systems, as all \ntranslations are multilingually aligned. By publicly releasing such a high-quality and high-coverage dataset, \nwe hope to foster progress in the machine translation community and beyond.","first_N":5,"first_N_keywords":["text-generation","translation","found","expert-generated","multilingual"],"keywords_longer_than_N":true},

The resulting dataset enables better assessment of model quality on the long tail of \nlow-resource languages, including the evaluation of many-to-many multilingual translation systems, as all \ntranslations are multilingually aligned.
