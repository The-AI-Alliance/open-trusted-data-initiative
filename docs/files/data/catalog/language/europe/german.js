The 26M token dataset is compiled from public resources using techniques such as heuristic-based sentence sampling, template extraction and slotting, and machine translation. We applied two NER models on our dataset: a baseline XLM-RoBERTa model, and a state-of-the-art GEMNET model that leverages gazetteers. The baseline achieves moderate performance (macro-F1=54%), highlighting the difficulty of our data. GEMNET, which uses gazetteers, improvement significantly (average improvement of macro-F1=+30%). MultiCoNER poses challenges even for large pre-trained language models, and we believe that it can help further research in building robust NER systems.

	{"name":"germeval2018","keyword":"german","description":"# Task Description\n\nParticipants were allowed to participate in one or\nboth tasks and submit at most three runs per task.\n\n## Task 1: Coarse-grained Binary Classification\n\nTask 1 was to decide whether a tweet includes some\nform of offensive language or not. The tweets had\nto be classified into the two classes OFFENSE and\nOTHER. The OFFENSE category covered abusive\nlanguage, insults, as well as merely profane statements.\n\n## Task 2: Fine-grained 4-way Classification\n\nThe second task involved four categories, a nonoffensive OTHER class and three sub-categories of what is OFFENSE in \nTask 1. In the case of PROFANITY, profane words are used, however, the tweet does not want to insult anyone. This \ntypically concerns the usage of swearwords (Scheiße, Fuck etc.) and cursing (Zur Holle! Verdammt! etc.). This can be \noften found in youth language. Swearwords and cursing may, but need not, co-occur with insults or abusive speech. \nProfane language may in fact be used in tweets with positive sentiment to express emphasis. Whenever profane words are \nnot directed towards a specific person or group of persons and there are no separate cues of INSULT or ABUSE, then \ntweets are labeled as simple cases of PROFANITY.\n\nIn the case of INSULT, unlike PROFANITY, the tweet clearly wants to offend someone. INSULT is the ascription of \nnegatively evaluated qualities or deficiencies or the labeling of persons as unworthy (in some sense) or unvalued. \nInsults convey disrespect and contempt. Whether an utterance is an insult usually depends on the community in which it \nis made, on the social context (ongoing activity etc.) in which it is made, and on the linguistic means that are used \n(which have to be found to be conventional means whose assessment as insulting are intersubjectively reasonably \nstable).\n\nAnd finally, in the case of ABUSE, the tweet does not just insult a person but represents the stronger form of abusive \nlanguage. By abuse we define a special type of degradation. This type of degrading consists in ascribing a social \nidentity to a person that is judged negatively by a (perceived) majority of society. The identity in question is seen \nas a shameful, unworthy, morally objectionable or marginal identity. In contrast to insults, instances of abusive \nlanguage require that the target of judgment is seen as a representative of a group and it is ascribed negative \nqualities that are taken to be universal, omnipresent and unchangeable characteristics of the group. (This part of the \ndefinition largely co-incides with what is referred to as abusive speech in other research.) Aside from the cases where \npeople are degraded based on their membership in some group, we also classify it as abusive language when \ndehumanization is employed even just towards an individual (i.e. describing a person as scum or vermin etc.).","url":"https://huggingface.co/datasets/gwlms/germeval2018","creator_name":"German Wikipedia LMs","creator_url":"https://huggingface.co/gwlms","license_name":"Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International Public License","license_url":"https://choosealicense.com/licenses/cc-by-4.0/","language":null,"first_N":5,"first_N_keywords":["text-classification","German","cc-by-4.0","🇺🇸 Region: US"],"keywords_longer_than_N":false},

Despite the availability of \nvarious open-source LLMs tailored for health contexts, adapting \ngeneral-purpose LLMs to the medical domain presents significant\nchallenges. In this paper, we introduce BioMistral, an open-source\nLLM tailored for the biomedical domain, utilizing Mistral as its \nfoundation model and further pre-trained on PubMed Central. We conduct \na comprehensive evaluation of BioMistral on a benchmark comprising 10 \nestablished medical question-answering (QA) tasks in English. We also \nexplore lightweight models obtained through quantization and model \nmerging approaches. Our results demonstrate BioMistral's superior \nperformance compared to existing open-source medical models and its \ncompetitive edge against proprietary counterparts. Finally, to address \nthe limited availability of data beyond English and to assess the multilingual \ngeneralization of medical LLMs, we automatically translated and evaluated this\nbenchmark into 7 other languages. This marks the first large-scale\nmultilingual evaluation of LLMs in the medical domain.

	{"name":"multiconer_v2","keyword":"german","description":"Complex named entities (NE), like the titles of creative works, are not simple nouns and pose challenges for NER systems (Ashwini and Choi, 2014). They can take the form of any linguistic constituent, like an imperative clause (“Dial M for Murder”), and do not look like traditional NEs (Persons, Locations, etc.). This syntactic ambiguity makes it challenging to recognize them based on context. We organized the MultiCoNER task (Malmasi et al., 2022) at SemEval-2022 to address these challenges in 11 languages, receiving a very positive community response with 34 system papers. Results confirmed the challenges of processing complex and long-tail NEs: even the largest pre-trained Transformers did not achieve top performance without external knowledge. The top systems infused transformers with knowledge bases and gazetteers. However, such solutions are brittle against out of knowledge-base entities and noisy scenarios like the presence of spelling mistakes and typos. We propose MultiCoNER II which represents novel challenges through new tasks that emphasize the shortcomings of the current top models.\n\nMultiCoNER II features complex NER in these languages:\n\n1.
