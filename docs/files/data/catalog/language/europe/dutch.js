The 26M token dataset is compiled from public resources using techniques such as heuristic-based sentence sampling, template extraction and slotting, and machine translation. We applied two NER models on our dataset: a baseline XLM-RoBERTa model, and a state-of-the-art GEMNET model that leverages gazetteers. The baseline achieves moderate performance (macro-F1=54%), highlighting the difficulty of our data. GEMNET, which uses gazetteers, improvement significantly (average improvement of macro-F1=+30%). MultiCoNER poses challenges even for large pre-trained language models, and we believe that it can help further research in building robust NER systems.

	{"name":"super_eurlex","keyword":"dutch","description":"Super-EURLEX dataset containing legal documents from multiple languages.\n                The datasets are build/scrapped from the EURLEX Website [https://eur-lex.europa.eu/homepage.html]\n                With one split per language and sector, because the available features (metadata) differs for each \n                sector. Therefore, each sample contains the content of a full legal document in up to 3 different \n                formats. Those are raw HTML and cleaned HTML (if the HTML format was available on the EURLEX website \n                during the scrapping process) and cleaned text.\n                The cleaned text should be available for each sample and was extracted from HTML or PDF.\n                'Cleaned' HTML stands here for minor cleaning that was done to preserve to a large extent the necessary \n                HTML information like table structures while removing unnecessary complexity which was introduced to the \n                original documents due to actions like writing each sentence into a new object. \n                Additionally, each sample contains metadata which was scrapped on the fly, this implies the following \n                2 things.
