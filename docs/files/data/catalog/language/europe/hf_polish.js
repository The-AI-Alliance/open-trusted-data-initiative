Current evaluation benchmarks either lack good coverage of low-resource \\nlanguages, consider only restricted domains, or are low quality because they are constructed using \\nsemi-automatic procedures. In this work, we introduce the FLORES evaluation benchmark, consisting of 3001 \\nsentences extracted from English Wikipedia and covering a variety of different topics and domains. \\nThese sentences have been translated in 101 languages by professional translators through a carefully \\ncontrolled process. The resulting dataset enables better assessment of model quality on the long tail of \\nlow-resource languages, including the evaluation of many-to-many multilingual translation systems, as all \\ntranslations are multilingually aligned. By publicly releasing such a high-quality and high-coverage dataset, \\nwe hope to foster progress in the machine translation community and beyond."},

However, current RE models often rely on small datasets with low coverage of relation types, particularly when working with languages other than English. \\\\In this paper, we address the above issue and provide two new resources that enable the training and evaluation of multilingual RE systems.\\nFirst, we present SRED\\\\textsuperscript{FM}, an automatically annotated dataset covering 18 languages, 400 relation types, 13 entity types, totaling more than 40 million triplet instances. Second, we propose RED\\\\textsuperscript{FM}, a smaller, human-revised dataset for seven languages that allows for the evaluation of multilingual RE systems. \\nTo demonstrate the utility of these novel datasets, we experiment with the first end-to-end multilingual RE model, mREBEL, \\nthat extracts triplets, including entity types, in multiple languages. We release our resources and model checkpoints at \\\\href{https://www.github.com/babelscape/rebel}{https://www.github.com/babelscape/rebel}."},

Current evaluation benchmarks either lack good coverage of low-resource \\nlanguages, consider only restricted domains, or are low quality because they are constructed using \\nsemi-automatic procedures. In this work, we introduce the FLORES evaluation benchmark, consisting of 3001 \\nsentences extracted from English Wikipedia and covering a variety of different topics and domains. \\nThese sentences have been translated in 101 languages by professional translators through a carefully \\ncontrolled process. The resulting dataset enables better assessment of model quality on the long tail of \\nlow-resource languages, including the evaluation of many-to-many multilingual translation systems, as all \\ntranslations are multilingually aligned. By publicly releasing such a high-quality and high-coverage dataset, \\nwe hope to foster progress in the machine translation community and beyond."},
