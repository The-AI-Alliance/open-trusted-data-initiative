This dataset is designed to represent contemporary challenges in NER, including low-context scenarios (short and uncased text), syntactically complex entities like movie titles, and long-tail entity distributions. The 26M token dataset is compiled from public resources using techniques such as heuristic-based sentence sampling, template extraction and slotting, and machine translation. We applied two NER models on our dataset: a baseline XLM-RoBERTa model, and a state-of-the-art GEMNET model that leverages gazetteers. The baseline achieves moderate performance (macro-F1=54%), highlighting the difficulty of our data. GEMNET, which uses gazetteers, improvement significantly (average improvement of macro-F1=+30%). MultiCoNER poses challenges even for large pre-trained language models, and we believe that it can help further research in building robust NER systems. MultiCoNER is publicly available at https://registry.opendata.aws/multiconer/ and we hope that this resource will help advance research in various aspects of NER.","url":"https://huggingface.co/datasets/tomaarsen/MultiCoNER","creator_name":"Tom Aarsen","creator_url":"https://huggingface.co/tomaarsen","license_name":"Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International Public License","license_url":"https://choosealicense.com/licenses/cc-by-4.0/","language":"en","first_N":5,"first_N_keywords":["token-classification","Bengali","German","English","Spanish"],"keywords_longer_than_N":true},

Despite the availability of \nvarious open-source LLMs tailored for health contexts, adapting \ngeneral-purpose LLMs to the medical domain presents significant\nchallenges. In this paper, we introduce BioMistral, an open-source\nLLM tailored for the biomedical domain, utilizing Mistral as its \nfoundation model and further pre-trained on PubMed Central. We conduct \na comprehensive evaluation of BioMistral on a benchmark comprising 10 \nestablished medical question-answering (QA) tasks in English. We also \nexplore lightweight models obtained through quantization and model \nmerging approaches. Our results demonstrate BioMistral's superior \nperformance compared to existing open-source medical models and its \ncompetitive edge against proprietary counterparts. Finally, to address \nthe limited availability of data beyond English and to assess the multilingual \ngeneralization of medical LLMs, we automatically translated and evaluated this\nbenchmark into 7 other languages. This marks the first large-scale\nmultilingual evaluation of LLMs in the medical domain.
