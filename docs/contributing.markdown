# How to Contribute to This Documentation

We welcome your contributions to this User Guide. The sources for this guide are in [this GitHub repo](https://github.com/The-AI-Alliance/open-trusted-data-initiatve){:target="tsug-repo"}. Please either [post issues](https://github.com/The-AI-Alliance/open-trusted-data-initiatve/issues){:target="tsug-repo"} or contribute changes as [pull requests](https://github.com/The-AI-Alliance/open-trusted-data-initiatve/pulls){:target="tsug-repo"}. Notice that every page has _Edit this page on GitHub_ links, making it easy to view a page, then go straight to the source to make edits and submit a PR! This is the best way to help us fix typos and make similar small edits.

The [README](https://github.com/The-AI-Alliance/open-trusted-data-initiatve){:target="tsug-repo"} for the User Guide source repo explains more details for testing the website locally and for creating more extensive changes as PRs, such as adding new content.
